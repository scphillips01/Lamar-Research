",0,0,0,10,"10 dogs were taken from Prince George AC in SAFE's name but was never transferred to HEART(Happy Endings Animal Rescue Team). We requested all paperwork, so we could transfer them to HEART. We assume that HEART adopted them out without permission from SAFE.  SAFE never saw any paperwork exchanged, the dogs were not signed over to HEART. I did inform the VDACS of the situation in 4/12. To this day I do not actually know what happened to those dogs, no paperwork was ever exchanged.

As suspected, last year's on hand number appears to have been inaccurate reflecting 14 fewer cats on hand on January 1, 2016, than we actually had.  We have redeveloped and made corrections to our database and seem to have resolved that discrepancy.  Consequently we have entered those 14 cats in the “other” (H)  field to reconcile the 2016 report.

First point of contact: Giles County Sheriff's Office and Giles County CWA, since this was adopter's county of residence, who had Java in temporary foster custody after Pocahontas Dog Training program. Dog subsequently disappeared, presumably concealed at PSCC with the full consent of Warden Stan Young. I contacted Tazewell County Sheriff's Office who maintained it was a civil matter and declined to investigate. Then contacted Michelle Welch with the SAG's office as well as Harold Clarke with VDOC. Learned from a former corrections officer named Danny Link that Warden Young contacted a rescue he is affiliated with (Augusta Dog Adoptions) acting as if the PSCC dog program was a releasing agency and stating they needed to place some dogs. I then contacted a representative from Augusta Dog Adoptions but she said they had not received Java.",24,2/17/17 14:45,3/20/17 15:49,,15
